The application we want to create handles two data objects, Customer and User. As its name reveals, Customer object contain customer related data, such as Name, Email, Age, Phone, and so on, and User object contains data related to the logged-in user on the system.

At this stage, it is important to define which objects will interact with our backend server and wich only live in the browser. In our application, Customer object will be loaded with data from the server, and User object will only be known by the front end application, that lives in the web browser.
